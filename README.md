#Procedural Gen
Procedural Gen is a collection of programs I wrote as a part of a research project for a higher-level mathematics course. In it, I wrote short implementations using the Mandelbrot set, Cellular Automata, the Diamond-Square algorithm, and erosion algorithms. One of the erosion algorithms I used, a raindrop algorithm, I could only find discussed in theory and as far as I can tell, I'm the first person to implement it and make the source code available online. Below are a couple sample outputs after an initial height map generated by the Diamond-Square algorithm and after going through several thousand passes of a raindrop and soil-filling algorithms.
